<h2><a href="11">CHILDREN</a> - WHAT YOU CAN DO</h2>
<h3>Drink Safe Water</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a private well, <a href="20">test your water for arsenic</a>. If your well has arsenic, switch to bottled water for drinking and cooking immediately and <a href="21">learn about your options</a> for getting arsenic out of your drinking water. </li> 
<li>If you're worried about arsenic in your drinking water, use bottled water to mix your baby formula until you are sure your home water supply is safe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diet Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor about breast-feeding your infant or toddler. Studies have found lower levels of arsenic in breast milk than in infant formula. </li>
<li>If you choose formula for your baby, find one that isn't made with <a href="19">rice or rice products</a> and <strong>avoid those with brown rice syrup</strong> listed as an ingredient.</li>
<li>Avoid rice milk for babies and young children. </li>
<li>Feed your baby solid foods besides rice. <strong>Try oat, barley, or multigrain but check with your doctor first</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong>Limit how much fruit juice your child drinks</strong>. Even better, give your child whole fruits instead. Drinking a lot of juice can be bad for health and teeth.</li>
<li><strong>Check with your pediatrician</strong> to make a list of healthy and low-arsenic food choices.</li>
<li>Eat a varied diet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be Proactive</h3>

<h2><a href="9">GLUTEN-FREE</a> - WHAT YOU CAN DO</h2>
<h3>Diet Choices</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Eat less rice and rice-based foods</strong> </li>
	<li><strong>Try new grains</strong>. Instead of eating rice in all of your meals, try other grains that have less arsenic in them. For instance:
			&rArr; <em>Quinoa</em>, &rArr; <em>Oats</em>, &rArr; <em>Corn</em>, &rArr; <em>Flax</em>, &rArr; <em>Amaranth</em>, &rArr; <em>Teff</em>, &rArr; <em>Millet</em>, or &rArr; <em>Buckwheat</em>.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Choose foods with less rice</strong>. When you buy packaged foods, be sure to check the ingredients label for the word “rice.” Eat less of this food or choose products that don't have rice in them. </li>
	<li><strong>Switch out your rice</strong>. Some types of rice have less arsenic than others. When you want to eat rice, choose:
		<ul> 
			<li>Quick-cooking rice</li>
			<li>Instant rice</li>
			<li>Sushi rice</li>
			<li>Basmati rice from India, Pakistan, or California</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cook your rice like you cook pasta</strong>. Cooking your rice with extra water and then draining it off can get rid of half the arsenic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be Proactive</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Read the recommendations on the <a href="19">Arsenic in Rice</a> page to learn about other options to reduce your arsenic exposure through rice.</li>
	<li>Eat a varied diet to make sure you're getting balanced nutrition.</li>
	<li>If you have a private well, <a href="20"><strong>test your water</a></strong> for arsenic!</li>
	<li>Review this site to better understand your <strong>total arsenic exposure</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Look for the What You Can Do action steps to reduce your arsenic exposure</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="19">RICE</a> - WHAT YOU CAN DO</h2>
<h3>Diet Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you can, <strong>choose lower arsenic types of rice</strong>. White rice is lower in arsenic than brown rice, but it is also lower in fiber and vitamins.</li> 
<li>Check to see where your rice is grown. <strong>Look for rice from regions that have rice lower in arsenic. White basmati rice from California, India, and Pakistan, and sushi rice from the U.S. may have less arsenic than other types of rice</strong>.</li>
<li>Vary your grains, <strong>especially if rice is a big part of your diet. Consider lower-arsenic grains such as amaranth, quinoa, bulgur and farro</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong>Check the labels on the snacks you like to see if they are made with rice, rice flour, or rice syrup</strong>. If they are, try to find new snack options that don't have rice in them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be sure the water you use for cooking rice does not contain high arsenic, since rice absorbs water as it cooks. You should not use water with more than <a href="29">10 parts per billion</a> of arsenic for cooking</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong>Cook your rice like you cook pasta (use six times as much water as rice and drain the rice after it's finished cooking) to get rid of about half the arsenic</strong>.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Keep a Balance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't eliminate rice completely from your diet</strong>, but find out how much arsenic you and your family may be consuming <a href="23">through food, water, and other sources</a>.</li>
<li>If you eat a lot of rice or other foods that are higher in arsenic, eat them less often or vary with others types of food that are lower in arsenic.</li>
<li>Review information from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm319870.htm" target="_blank">U.S.Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/how-much-arsenic-is-in-your-rice/index.htm" target="_blank">Consumer Reports</a> which provides <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/UCM352467.pdf" target="_blank">details on arsenic levels in rice products</a>.</li>

<h2><a href="18">FRUITS, VEGGIES & JUICE</a> - WHAT YOU CAN DO</h2>
<h3>Be Proactive</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Keep eating fruits and vegetables, since they are so good for your health.</li> 
       <li>Review the section below, <em><strong>Where is the arsenic?</em></strong> to learn where the arsenic goes in the plants you like to eat.</li>
<li>Vary the fruits and vegetables that you eat, particularly if you are exposed to arsenic through <a href="20">private well water</a>, <a href="23">other foods or other sources</a>. Some fruits and veggies have more arsenic than others, so you don't want to eat too much of any one kind.</li>
	<li>Always wash all fruits and vegetables before eating or cooking them and if you can, scrub them with a brush to help you get rid of any soil with arsenic in it. </li>
</ul>

<h3>If You Grow Your Own</h3>
<ul>
<li>Test your soil for arsenic and other metals. </li>
<li>Talk with your town, city or <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/fsis-content/internet/main/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/additional-recall-links/state-departments-of-public-health/ct_index" target="_blank">state health department</a>  or Cooperative Extension Service to ask about soil testing procedures. </li>
<li>Remove soil and wash fruits and vegetables before bringing them into your home, then scrub them with a brush. </li>
<li>If you are a home gardener in an area with high arsenic in the soil (see <a href="26">locations with higher risk of arsenic exposure</a>), limit the amount of lettuce, radishes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale and cabbage you eat. </li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.gardenroots.arizona.edu/get-started#tips" target="_blank">Garden Roots</a> project at the University of Arizona provides more information on growing your own garden safely. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Lower the Juice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit children's fruit juice consumption to 4-6 ounces a day, or avoid juice altogether and eat whole fruits instead. Some juices, like <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm280202.htm" target="_blank">apple or pear juice</a>, can have higher amounts of arsenic.</li>
</ul>
