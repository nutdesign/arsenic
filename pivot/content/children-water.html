## Why is arsenic bad for babies and children?

Young children have very small bodies and eat more food per pound of body weight as they grow. As a result, they get more arsenic from food or drinks, compared to adults. For babies and kids, studies have shown that having arsenic in their bodies over time can lead to:

* Lower IQ
* Impaired brain development
* Growth problems
* Breathing problems (?)
* An unhealthy immune system 
* Cancer as an adult

Pregnant women should also be careful not to eat or drink arsenic, because it can get into their baby's body too. Arsenic can cross the placenta, which means that a pregnant woman's arsenic exposure through food and water may affect her baby's growth and development or lead to health problems later on.

<ul>
<li>If you have a private well, <a href="20">test your water for arsenic</a>. If your well has arsenic, switch to bottled water for drinking and cooking immediately and <a href="21">learn about your options</a> for getting arsenic out of your drinking water. </li> 
<li>Talk to your doctor about breast-feeding your infant or toddler. Studies have found lower levels of arsenic in breast milk than in infant formula. </li>
<li>If you choose formula for your baby, find one that isn't made with <a href="19">rice or rice products</a> and avoid those with brown rice syrup listed as an ingredient.</li>
<li>If you're worried about arsenic in your drinking water, use bottled water to mix your baby formula.</li>
<li>Avoid rice milk for babies and young children. </li>
<li>Feed your baby solid foods besides rice. Try oat, barley, or multigrain but check with your doctor first.</li> 
<li>Limit how much fruit juice your child drinks. Even better, give your child whole fruits instead. Drinking a lot of juice can be bad for health and teeth.</li>
<li>Eat a varied diet.</li>
<li>Make sure to teach your kids to wash their hands after playing outside.</li> 
<li>Don't let your kids eat off of wooden picnic tables.</li> 
<li>Check with your pediatrician to make a list of healthy and low-arsenic food choices.</li>
<li>Learn about your biggest sources of arsenic and your total arsenic exposure and take action to reduce arsenic in your world as much as possible.</li>

	<h4>What foods should I be concerned about for my child?</h4>
	<p>Some foods have more arsenic than others. Examples include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rice cereal</li>
		<li>Rice snacks</li>
		<li>Rice milk</li>
		<li>Baby formula made with rice </li>
		<li>Foods with organic brown rice syrup</li>
		<li>Apple juice (pear juice? See FDA)</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>How do I know how much arsenic is in the foods I give my child?</h4>
	<p>It's best to reduce or avoid these foods if you can. When you go to the grocery store, you won't see labels on foods saying how much arsenic is in them. In the U.S., there are no laws about labels or limits on arsenic in foods.</p>

## How can you reduce arsenic for your children?

Pregnant women, babies, and kids consume arsenic mostly through food and water. Keep reading for steps to lower the amount of arsenic you and your kids get from food, water, and other sources.

### Water
If you have a private well, <a href="20">test your water</a> for arsenic. If your well contains arsenic at or above 10 parts per billion (link): 
<ul>
<li>Switch to bottled water right away. </li>
<li><a href="21">Install a treatment system</a>, join a public water supply, or dig a new well.
	<ul>
		<li>If you're pregnant, or if you have young kids, look for a treatment system that lowers arsenic levels to close to zero. </li>
		<li>Some treatment systems remove arsenic from just a single tap, like your kitchen sink. If you choose that system, make sure your kids don't swallow water while bathing or brushing their teeth.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

### Baby formula
Studies have shown that breastfed babies drink less arsenic than babies who are given formula. If your baby drinks formula, check to see if it contains <a href="19">rice</a> or brown rice syrup and choose a brand that does not contain these ingredients. Or, check with your pediatrician first, and then choose a formula made from cow's milk or soy. Always use water with little to no arsenic to mix it. Bottled water is the safest option. 


### Rice and rice products

<a href="19">Rice and rice products</a> are in many baby foods and drinks. Rice cereal is a common first food, but other foods work just as well. Choose foods like:

* Oatmeal
* Millet
* Veggie purees 
* Sweet potatoes
* Finely chopped meat 

### Rice milk

Babies and young kids shouldn't drink rice drinks. If your child can't drink cow's milk, choose:

* Oat milk 
* Soy milk 
* Almond milk 

### Fruit juice (name which ones!)

Some fruit juices (link to page- say which ones! See FDA) can have arsenic in them, so limit the amount of juice your child drinks to avoid the possibility of arsenic exposure and to reduce risk of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Whole fruit is a better option.

### Eat a varied diet

Eating a varied diet is an important way to decrease a child's exposure to toxins in any one food. Serving a wide range of foods provides a variety of nutrients to support healthy growth and development. While rice can be a part of a child's balanced diet, make sure to include other grains such as oats, barley, wheat and corn (check with your pediatrician to make a list of healthy and low-arsenic food choices).

## Arsenic in the environment
### Soil

Soils in some parts of the country contain high levels of arsenic. Try to keep children from eating dirt when they play outside. Because <a href="18">fruits and vegetables</a> can have soil on them, be sure to always wash them before eating or cooking. 

### Wood

Old wood playground equipment, decks, and picnic tables can sometimes have arsenic on them from a chemical that was used to <a href="30">pressure-treat wood</a>. Make sure your kids wash their hands after playing outside and that they don't eat off of wooden picnic tables. The best way to keep your kids safe from arsenic on wood is to apply a sealant every two years if the wood contains the chemical.

> "Take action to avoid arsenic if you're a pregnant women, or have kids. Arsenic is harmful to child growth, development, and brain function. Kids consume more food and water per pound of body weight, so they are more likely than other age groups to be exposed to too much arsenic." <cite>June Smith, Professor of Science, College University </cite>
