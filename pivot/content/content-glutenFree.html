## Should you be concerned about arsenic if you eat a gluten-free diet?

Yes. Like most people on a gluten-free diet, rice is likely in a lot of your meals, baked goods, and snacks. Rice can have arsenic at levels that can cause significant <a href="24">health impacts</a> later in life. When you can, **eat foods that aren't made with rice and try other grains, like oats and quinoa, instead**.

## What gluten-free foods have arsenic in them?

Rice is the main gluten-free food with arsenic in it. If you eat a gluten-free diet, you may eat a lot of rice or foods made with rice, such as:

* Cookies made with rice flour 
* Crackers made with rice flour 
* Rice-based pasta 
* Rice cereal 
* Rice cakes 
* Rice-based baking mixes

<div class="callout"><h3>WHAT YOU CAN DO</h3>
<h4>Diet Choices</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Eat less rice and rice-based foods</strong> </li>
	<li><strong>Try new grains</strong>. Instead of eating rice in all of your meals, try other grains that have less arsenic in them. For instance:
			&rArr; <em>Quinoa</em>, &rArr; <em>Oats</em>, &rArr; <em>Corn</em>, &rArr; <em>Flax</em>, &rArr; <em>Amaranth</em>, &rArr; <em>Teff</em>, &rArr; <em>Millet</em>, or &rArr; <em>Buckwheat</em>.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Choose foods with less rice</strong>. When you buy packaged foods, be sure to check the ingredients label for the word “rice.” Eat less of this food or choose products that don't have rice in them. </li>
	<li><strong>Switch out your rice</strong>. Some types of rice have less arsenic than others. When you want to eat rice, choose:
		<ul> 
			<li>Quick-cooking rice</li>
			<li>Instant rice</li>
			<li>Sushi rice</li>
			<li>Basmati rice from India, Pakistan, or California</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<h4>Cooking</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cook your rice like you cook pasta</strong>. Cooking your rice with extra water and then draining it off can get rid of half the arsenic.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Be Proactive</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Read the recommendations on the <a href="19">Arsenic in Rice</a> page to learn about other options to reduce your arsenic exposure through rice.</li>
	<li>Eat a varied diet to make sure you're getting balanced nutrition.</li>
	<li>If you have a private well, <a href="20"><strong>test your water</a></strong> for arsenic!</li>
	<li>Review this site to better understand your <strong>total arsenic exposure</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Look for the What You Can Do action steps to reduce your arsenic exposure</strong>.</li>

> "We estimate that with the higher concentrations of inorganic arsenic in white and brown rice and rice-based ingredients, people who eat a lot of rice - such as in many gluten-free diets - have an increased risk of inorganic arsenic exposure. Studies haven't yet confirmed this, and the amount of increased arsenic exposure is not known. However, people on a gluten-free diet who are concerned about arsenic exposure should eat a varied, nutritious diet and stay informed about arsenic in food." <cite>Dr. Tracy Punshon, Dartmouth College </cite>
