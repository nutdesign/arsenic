# How much arsenic is in your world?

<p class="lead">Everyone should be aware of the amount of arsenic in their food and water. Anyone can take action to reduce their arsenic exposure and protect their family's long-term health.</p>


## Should I be worried about arsenic?

Arsenic isn't just a deadly poison from a mystery story. In the U.S., many people are exposed to very small amounts of arsenic through their food and drinking water at levels that may increase their risk of certain diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.

By following the simple recommendations in this website, you can reduce your total arsenic exposure. Reducing your arsenic exposure now will improve your long-term health.
 
While it's impossible to totally eliminate arsenic from your world, keeping your arsenic intake as close to zero as possible is a good goal. At very high doses, arsenic causes serious and immediate health effects (that's why people know it best as a poison!), but in the U.S., levels of arsenic in food and water are usually too low to cause obvious symptoms or make you sick right away. But consuming small amounts or arsenic every day through your food and water can increase your risk of getting certain diseases later in life unless you take action now to reduce your exposure.

While everyone should be aware of their arsenic consumption, in the U.S., private well owners, infants, children, pregnant women, people who eat a lot of rice, and smokers are most vulnerable to the effects of arsenic. If you think you are exposed to too much arsenic from one or more sources, there are steps you can take to reduce your arsenic exposure now that will boost your chances of staying healthy long-term.

## Where does arsenic come from?

Arsenic is a metal that is found in rocks, soil, air, water, plants and animals. Arsenic has also been used in pesticides, animal feed, and certain industrial processes. As scientists are learning more about the importance of keeping arsenic exposure low, industry and food producers are taking steps to reduce the amount of arsenic in the environment. The use of pesticides containing arsenic has been banned on food-producing land, drug companies have removed arsenic from animal feed, and arsenic is no longer used to pressure treat wood in residential structures.

## How is arsenic regulated?

The EPA regulates arsenic in public water supplies, and the FDA regulates arsenic in bottled water and has proposed regulations for some food products that are likely to contain harmful amounts of arsenic.  

There are not limits on arsenic in many foods and if you drink from a private well, it is your responsibility to make sure your well water does not contain arsenic. This is particularly important if you are pregnant or have infants or children in your house, since studies have found that arsenic negatively affects growth and development.

> "At very high doses, arsenic can be a deadly poison, but that's not what people should be worried about. In the U.S., people who eat a lot of foods that are high in arsenic or drink water from wells that have not been treated for arsenic are at higher risk for developing health problems such as heart disease and cancer later in life. If people learn how to reduce their arsenic exposure today, they can increase their chances of staying healthy in the future." <cite>June Smith, Professor of Science, College University</cite>
