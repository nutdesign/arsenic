## Why is arsenic a problem?

You can't see, smell, or taste arsenic. At **very high levels, arsenic can cause death or harmful health effects**. In the U.S., levels of arsenic in food and water are usually too low to make you sick right away. 

If you are **exposed to low amounts of arsenic every day, through your food, water or other sources**, you increase your risk for: 

* Cancer 
* Heart disease 
* Diabetes 
* and other <a href="24">health concerns</a> **later in life**. 


## Where is the arsenic?

Arsenic is a metalloid naturally found in rocks, soil, air, water, plants and animals. Arsenic has also been used in pesticides, animal feed, and certain industrial processes. Human activities that result in arsenic entering our environment include: 

Burning coal for energy; mining metals; metal smelting operations; pesticide application; glass manufacture; disposal of wastewater sludges; pharmaceutical waste; livestock dips; phosphate fertilizer application; wood preservatives; and chemotherapeutic drugs.

  <figcaption>In the U.S., high concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic are more common in the West, Midwest, parts of Texas, and Northeast, but can occur almost anywhere. This map shows the probability of arsenic in private well water from 1 to 50 parts per billion (ppb). Note: 1 ug/L is the same as 1 ppb. **Remember, arsenic is not just a problem in those regions, so <a href="20">test your well for arsenic</a> no matter where you live.** Data and map - U.S. Geological Survey </figcaption>
