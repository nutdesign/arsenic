##Why is arsenic a problem?

You can't see smell, or taste arsenic. At very high doses, arsenic causes harmful health effects. In the U.S., levels of arsenic in food and water are often too low to make you sick right away. 

But taking in small amounts of arsenic every day, through your food and water, can increase your risk for: 

* Cancer 
* Heart disease 
* Diabetes 
* and other <a href="24">health concerns</a> later in life. Since arsenic causes cancer, no level of exposure is completely safe.

## How is arsenic regulated?

* There are currently no U.S. regulatory limits on arsenic in food. 
* The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates arsenic in public water supplies.(link)
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates arsenic in bottled water and has proposed regulations for rice and apple juice which testing has shown contain higher levels of arsenic.(links here)
* If you drink from a private well, it is your responsibility to test your well water for arsenic. 

> "Arsenic has no taste, smell or color.  It is in foods and beverages, drinking water, soil, pressure treated wood and cigarettes. While everyone is exposed to some arsenic, learn about the potential sources of arsenic in your daily life, and make simple changes to keep your arsenic exposure as low as possible to protect your long-term health." <cite>Dr. Margaret Kurzius-Spencer, University of Arizona </cite>
