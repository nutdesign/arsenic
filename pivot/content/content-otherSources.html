## Arsenic in Pressure-Treated Wood

Older wooden structures like decks, picnic tables and play structures were treated commonly pressure treated with an arsenic-containing chemical, but you can take action to keep your family safe from arsenic in pressure-treated wood. 

### How does arsenic get into wood?

Before 2003, wooden play structures, decks, and picnic tables were pressure-treated with an arsenic-based pesticide called CCA (Chromated Copper Arsenate). Over time, arsenic makes its way to the surface of the wood, where it spreads easily onto hands or gets into nearby soils.

### Why is arsenic in wood a big deal for kids?

Young children are most at risk of arsenic exposure from CCA-treated wood since they are more likely to play on wooden structures or in the dirt around them, and because kids are more likely touch their mouth with unwashed hands and accidently swallow arsenic. It is important to reduce arsenic exposure as much as possible because arsenic can cause cancer and other health effects. Children are particularly vulnerable because arsenic can cause problems with growth and development, so if you have children at home, it's very important to think about how to minimize their arsenic exposure.

### What can I do?

In 2003, U.S. manufacturers of wood preservatives containing arsenic phased out the use of arsenic-containing preservatives in wood products for certain residential uses, such as play structures, picnic tables, decks, fencing, and boardwalks. However, wood structures built before 2003 are likely to contain CCA, and if children play on those structures, they are likely to pick up arsenic residues on their hands from the surface of the wood. Arsenic is not easily absorbed through the skin, but it can be ingested if kids touch arsenic-treated wood and then put their hands in their mouths.  Encouraging kids to wash their hands after playing in areas that may contain CCA treated wood is a good strategy to keep them from ingesting arsenic. You can test to learn if your picnic table, deck or play structure was treated with CCA. The best way to minimize arsenic leaching if the wood is CCA-treated is to apply a sealant like an oil-based stain to the wood once a year.

<div class="callout"><h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn if wooden structures that kids interact with frequently, such as picnic tables and play structures, were built before 2003, since wood was commonly treated with arsenic-based chemicals before then </li>
<li>Apply a sealant to the wood at least once a year </li>
<li>Wash hands after coming into contact with arsenic-treated wood, particularly before eating </li>
<li>Keep children and pets away from dirt beneath and surrounding arsenic-treated materials </li>
<li>Do not eat directly off of an arsenic-treated picnic table </li>
</ul>

## Is Arsenic More of a Problem for Smokers?

People who smoke are more likely to have health problems related to arsenic, both because cigarette smoke contains arsenic, and because smoking makes it harder for your body to get rid of arsenic before it damages your cells. 

Tobacco contains arsenic, so smokers are exposed to arsenic by inhaling cigarette smoke. Since arsenic exposure and smoking can increase your risk of lung, kidney, and bladder cancer, it's important to keep your exposure to arsenic through food and water as low as possible. Smoking also makes it harder for your body to process and get rid of arsenic. Arsenic exposure and smoking each increase your risk of diseases like cancer and heart disease. Studies show that for someone who smokes and is exposed to arsenic, there is an even greater risk of arsenic-related health outcomes such as heart disease.

## Locations with Higher Risk of Arsenic Exposure

Arsenic occurs naturally in water, soil, and bedrock and can be at high levels in certain regions of the United States. Arsenic is also released into the environment from human activities such as mining, agriculture, industrial activity, or energy production. Arsenic levels in water and soil may be higher in communities:

* Near existing or former smelters, fossil fuel-fired electrical power plants, or cement manufacturing facilities
* On or near former fruit orchards treated with lead-arsenate pesticides
* Near tailings from current or former metal ore mines
* Near old landfills
* Near an arsenic contaminated Superfund site
* In regions where arsenic is naturally high in rocks and soil

Find out if you live near a location with high arsenic exposure due to natural sources or human activities to be sure you are aware of all sources of arsenic so you can take action to reduce arsenic in your world.

> "Know the land! Certain areas may have high levels of arsenic in their soil and water from past or ongoing activities that released arsenic into the environment. For example, communities located near uncontrolled active or past mining or smelter sites or former orchards could potentially be exposed to arsenic through soil, water, food or dust. Also, communities where well water is the primary source of drinking water should learn about their water quality by conducting their own water monitoring test or by requesting a water consumer report from their water provider. It is important for a resident to learn about the environmental quality of their soil, water, air and food and, if necessary, what they can do to reduce their arsenic exposure."  <cite>Dr. Monica Ramirez-Andreotta, University of Arizona</cite>

<div class="callout"><h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are concerned about arsenic in your home or in your community, contact your local department of health or environmental quality to learn more about the issue. </li>
<li><a href="20">Test your water</a>!  If your drinking water comes from a private well, be sure your drinking water does not contain unsafe arsenic levels. </li>
<li>If you are on a public water supply (not a private well), request your water consumer or quality report from your water provider. </li>
<li>Visit your state department of environmental quality online to see where existing Department of Defense and state and federal Superfund sites are located. You can visit the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> to learn more about federal Superfund sites and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program">toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities</a>.  </li>
<li>If you are a gardener or have children who play outside, you may want to test your soils to determine the concentration of arsenic and/or heavy metals. Ask your local health or environmental quality department or state university cooperative extension about how to collect soil samples to test for arsenic and where to submit samples.  It is important to learn what the natural (or background) arsenic levels are in your state and residential area to see if your soil arsenic levels are high. If you are a gardener and are worried about the arsenic levels in your soils, learn about reducing <a href="18">arsenic exposure in homegrown vegetables</a> and teach kids to wash hands after playing in soil and before eating.  </li>
</ul>
