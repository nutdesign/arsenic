This website was created by the Columbia Superfund Research Program to raise awareness about the issue of arsenic in private wells in New Jersey, as well as to spur at-risk residents to action testing and subsequently treating their water, if necessary. The site contains high quality videos about arsenic’s health effects, testing water for arsenic, and installing an arsenic treatment system. There are also pages on testing, treatment, and FAQs about arsenic in well water. Even if you aren’t from New Jersey, the information on this site is relevant to private well owners everywhere!

## Consumer Reports 
### Arsenic in Rice

### Be Well Informed Guide

<a href="https://xml2.des.state.nh.us/DWITool/Welcome.aspx">https://xml2.des.state.nh.us/DWITool/Welcome.aspx</a>

The Be Well Informed Guide from NHDES is designed to help you understand your water test results and, if your well water has commonly found pollutants in it, provide information about health concerns and water treatment choices.  While many private wells provide safe drinking water, certain pollutants like arsenic are sometimes present in groundwater at levels that can affect your health and home. With your water test results in hand, click the button on the site to enter your test results from your laboratory report. You will receive an evaluation of your well water quality and, if advisable, water treatment options. Regardless of water treatment technology, it is essential that your treatment system is maintained on schedule in order for it to work properly. While this guide is made by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, it’s a useful tool for private well owners around the country.
