<a href="https://xml2.des.state.nh.us/DWITool/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">Be Well Informed Guide</a>

The *Be Well Informed Guide* from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services is designed to help you understand your water test results and, if your well water has commonly found pollutants in it, provide information about health concerns and water treatment choices. While many private wells provide safe drinking water, certain pollutants like arsenic are sometimes present in groundwater at levels that can affect your health and home. With your water test results in hand, click the button on the site to enter your test results from your laboratory report. You will receive an evaluation of your well water quality and, if advisable, water treatment options. Regardless of water treatment technology, it is essential that your treatment system is maintained on schedule in order for it to work properly. While this guide is made by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, it's a useful tool for private well owners around the country.
