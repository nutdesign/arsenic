## Should you be concerned about arsenic in rice?

It depends. Rice is healthy, doesn't cost much, and is in many dishes. But it can also have high amounts of arsenic. Like other people in the U.S., you might be eating a lot of rice or having it often. If you or someone in your family has special diet needs, you probably eat even more rice, such as:

* Gluten-free foods made with rice 
* Rice milk 
* Rice cereal 
* Rice-based baby formula 
* Brown rice syrup 

You don't need to take rice completely out of your diet, but it's good to know how much arsenic you and your family may be eating in your foods. 

<div class="callout"><h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vary your grains, especially if rice is a big part of your diet. Consider lower-arsenic grains such as amaranth, quinoa, bulgur and farro.</li> 
<li>When you can, choose lower arsenic types of rice. White rice is lower in arsenic than brown rice, but it is also lower in fiber and vitamins.</li> 
<li>Check to see where your rice is grown. Look for rice from regions have rice lower in arsenic. White basmati rice from California, India, and Pakistan, and sushi rice from the U.S. may have less arsenic than other types of rice.</li>
<li>Be sure the water you use for cooking rice does not contain high arsenic, since rice absorbs water as it cooks. You should not use water with more than 10 parts per billion [link to glossary] of arsenic for cooking.</li> 
<li>Cook your rice like you cook pasta (Use six times as much water as rice and drain the rice after it's finished cooking) to get rid of about half the arsenic.</li> 
<li>Check the labels on the snacks you like to see if they are made with rice, rice flour, or rice syrup. If they are, try to find new snack options that don't have rice in them.</li> 
<li>Don't eliminate rice completely from your diet, but find out how much arsenic you and your family may be consuming through food, water, and other sources.</li>
<li>If you eat a lot of rice or other foods that are higher in arsenic [link to food pages} eat them less often or vary with others types of food that are lower in arsenic.</li>
<li>Consult Information from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm280202.htm">U.S.Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/how-much-arsenic-is-in-your-rice/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a> which provides details on arsenic levels in rice products.</li>

## Are there types of rice with less arsenic?

Yes. Some types of rice have more arsenic in them than other types. To lower the amount of arsenic you get from rice, here are some tips:

<ul>
	<li>Buy either organic or non-organic rice—choose the one you prefer. They have about the same amount of arsenic in them.</li>
	<li>Think about swapping some of your brown rice for white rice. While white rice has less fiber and vitamins, it also has 80% less arsenic than brown rice.</li>
	<li>When you buy <strong>white rice</strong>, choose from these types that are lower in arsenic:
		<ul>
			<li>Basmati rice from India, Pakistan, or California</li>
			<li>Sushi rice from the U.S.</li>
			<li>Instant rice</li>
			<li>Quick-cooking rice</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When you buy <strong>brown rice</strong>, choose a Basmati rice from India, Pakistan, or California. These types are lower in arsenic.</li>
</ul>

## What if you're gluten-free?

Since you don't eat gluten, you're likely eating rice in many of your foods. You may be getting arsenic from:

<ul>
	<li>Plain rice</li>
	<li>Rice in dishes</li>
	<li>Gluten-free baked goods made with rice flour like:
		<ul>
			<li>Crackers</li>
			<li>Cookies</li>
			<li>Pastries</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

To lower the amount of arsenic you eat, swap your rice for some other grains like: 

* Millet
* Quinoa
* Amaranth
* Buckwheat
* Farro
* Bulgur
* Potatoes

Read the labels on gluten-free foods, and choose ones without rice.


## Is arsenic a bigger problem for my kids?

Even though babies and kids younger than five have little bodies, they need a lot of energy—which they get from food. Babies and kids eat about three times more food per pound of body weight than adults. That means that when a baby or kid eats a food with arsenic in it, they have three times more exposure to arsenic. [be sure ok to say] 

Many baby foods and kid foods are made with rice, such as:

* Rice cereals 
* Rice-based baby formula 
* Rice milk 

## Can you lower the amount of arsenic in rice through cooking?

Yes. Cook your rice the same way you cook your pasta—use six times the amount of water as rice and drain the water after cooking. This will get rid of about half the arsenic. Also, be sure that you are cooking with safe water. To learn more about arsenic in water, click here.

## Why is there arsenic in rice?

When they're growing, rice plants take in more arsenic than other plants do. The plants absorb the arsenic from the soil, from the irrigation water when it is grown in flooded fields, and from farming chemicals that used to be used in rice fields.

## Is there regulation of arsenic in rice?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed an action level [link] for arsenic in infant rice cereal of 100 parts per billion [link to glossary], which is the same as the international standard [link here?] for arsenic in rice products for children. Other rice products are not regulated in the U.S., although international standards exist for arsenic levels in rice.

> "Rice can be part of a low arsenic diet, but it's important to vary your grains. If you do eat rice, there are lower arsenic varieties to choose from, and cooking your rice like you cook pasta reduces arsenic even more. Anything that reduces your arsenic exposure is a good choice, especially for pregnant women and children." <cite>Carolyn Murray, Dartmouth College</cite>
