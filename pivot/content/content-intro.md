<h4> Check the brand </h4>

Some rice companies are testing and providing information on the amount of arsenic in their rice or rice-containing products; research your favorite brands to see if their products have low arsenic (examples: Nature's One, Lundberg Farms) Consumer Reports tested rice brands extensively and published the numbers so you can decide for yourself which brands you trust:  <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/magazine-articles/2012/November/Consumer%20Reports%20Arsenic%20in%20Food%20November%202012_1.pdf">http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/magazine-articles/2012/November/Consumer%20Reports%20Arsenic%20in%20Food%20November%202012_1.pdf</a>

<h4> Substitutes for rice </h4>

Wheat and oats tend to have lower arsenic levels than rice, as do gluten-free grains such as quinoa, millet and amaranth. The FDA recommends diversifying grains to maximize nutrition and suggests alternatives to rice such as oats, sweet potatoes and avocados as first solid foods for children.

<h4> Cook your rice in excess water</h4>

Research has shown that rinsing raw rice thoroughly before cooking, then using a ratio of 6 cups water to 1 cup rice for cooking and draining the excess water afterward, removes about 30% of the rice's inorganic arsenic content. However, this method of cooking may sacrifice some of rice's nutritional value by removing some vitamins and nutrients as well as arsenic.
