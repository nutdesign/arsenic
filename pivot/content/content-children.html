# Why is arsenic a big deal for babies and kids?

<p class="lead">Avoiding arsenic is especially important for pregnant women, infants, and kids, since arsenic can negatively affect growth and development in early life. </p>


## What are the health effects of arsenic for babies and kids?

Studies have found that arsenic may affect children's growth and immune function, brain development, and the risk of getting certain cancers when they are older. Arsenic is a big deal for kids since their bodies are growing so they eat more for their size than adults, and they are more likely to eat the same foods every day, which could mean too much exposure if those foods are higher in arsenic. 

Arsenic can cross the placenta, which means that a pregnant woman's arsenic exposure through food and water may affect her baby's growth and development. Arsenic intake for pregnant women, infants and children should be as low as possible. Since the arsenic content of most food products is not regulated or labeled, it's important for families to think about what their biggest sources of arsenic exposure are and take action to get as close to arsenic-free as possible.

## How can you get arsenic out of your kids' world?

Pregnant women, babies and kids are exposed to arsenic mostly through food and water. 
If your drinking water comes from a private well, make sure you test it for arsenic. Also, think about the foods your kids eat the most and choose low-arsenic options whenever possible. 

### Water

If you have a private well, test your water for arsenic. If your well contains greater than 10 parts per billion of arsenic, immediately switch to bottled water and make a plan to reduce your drinking water's arsenic levels, either by installing an arsenic treatment system, joining a public water supply, or digging a new well. 

If you are pregnant, or if you have infants or young children in your family, you may want to consider looking for a treatment system that reduces arsenic levels to as close to zero as possible, since children are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of arsenic. If you choose an arsenic treatment system that only removes arsenic from a single tap, ensure that children do not swallow water while bathing or brushing their teeth.

### Infant formula

Studies have shown that breast-fed infants have lower arsenic exposure than infants who are fed formula. If you do choose formula for your infant, check the ingredients to see if it contains rice or brown rice syrup. When possible, choose a formula without these ingredients and consider a cows' milk or soy protein-based infant formula. Research the brands of baby formula you purchase to see if there is any information available about the amount of arsenic in the formulas they offer. Also, when mixing powdered or concentrated formula with water, it is very important to use water with as little arsenic as possible. Use bottled water if you are concerned about the amount of arsenic in your drinking water.

### Rice and rice products

Because rice is common, cheap, healthy, and is less likely to cause allergic reactions for babies' sensitive stomachs, rice and rice products such as rice starch, rice flour and brown rice syrup are common in infant foods and drinks. Infant rice cereal is a popular first solid food, but other foods work just as well. Consider other grains like oatmeal or millet, vegetable purees, sweet potatoes, or finely chopped meat for your first.

### Rice milk

The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommends that infants and young children avoid rice drinks.  Consider alternatives to rice milk for young children, such as oat milk, soy milk and almond milk.

### Fruit juice

Arsenic has been measured in fruit juices at levels slightly above the EPA limit for drinking water (10 parts per billion). The FDA has proposed an action level to ensure that apple juice contains no more than the drinking water maximum limit for arsenic (10 ppb). Still, the American Association of Pediatrics recommends that parents try to limit the amount of sweet beverages your child drinks, both to avoid the possibility of arsenic exposure and to reduce risk of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.

### Eating a varied diet

For children, eating a varied diet is an important way to decrease a child's exposure to toxins in any one food. Plus eating a wide range of foods provides a variety of nutrients to support healthy growth and development. While rice can be included in a child's balanced diet, make sure to also include a variety of grains such as oats, barley, wheat and corn (check with your pediatrician to make a list of healthy and low-arsenic food choices).

## Arsenic in the environment

Soils in some parts of the country contain high levels of arsenic. If you grow your own fruits and vegetables or buy them from a farmer's market, wash them carefully to remove dirt that may contain arsenic.

Wood playground equipment, decks, and picnic tables are another potential source of arsenic for children, since there is a type of chemical containing arsenic called CCA (chromated copper arsenate) that was used to pressure-treat wood. CCA is now banned for structures that kids would use or play around, but older structures (built before 2002) may contain the chemical and children who touch or eat off of wooden structures may pick up arsenic off of the wood's surface. You can test to learn if your picnic table, deck or play structure was treated with CCA. The best way to minimize arsenic leaching if the wood is CCA-treated is to apply a sealant every two years. 

Kids should wash their hands after playing on play structures to wash off any arsenic residues from CCA-treated wood if you haven't had the wood tested. Also avoid eating directly off of wooden picnic tables unless you know the wood is free of CCA or treated with a sealant.
