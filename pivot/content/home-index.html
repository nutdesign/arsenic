# What You Need to Know About Arsenic

<p class="lead">We hope this website will answer your questions about arsenic and the ways in which you can lower your exposure to this toxic metal. By combining information about exposure through, food, water and other, less common exposure pathways, we hope to provide all the information you need to make choices to improve yours and your family's overall health. </p>


## Arsenic is a Hazardous Substance

Arsenic is a toxic metal ranked #1 on the Priority List of Hazardous Substances by the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.  Research has shown that chronic exposure to arsenic at levels as low as ten parts per billion is associated with many negative health outcomes, such as increased rates of skin, lung and bladder cancer, cardiovascular disease, reduced immune response, and impaired fetal and child development. The type of arsenic in rice is primarily inorganic arsenic, which is more toxic than the less toxic organic arsenic that is dominant in seafood. 

Arsenic affects many systems in your body by disrupting certain important functions in your cells. This can affect child development, your immune system, your heart health, and can increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer.

## Arsenic is a Natural Substance

Protecting against low-level arsenic exposure is challenging because arsenic is a natural substance; it's a metal that's found in soil, air, water, plants and animals. However, there is variation in the amount of arsenic in water and in food, and it's possible to decrease your arsenic exposure significantly by making smart choices about your diet and your drinking water. Since arsenic is a carcinogen, or a substance that causes cancer, there is no level of arsenic exposure that is completely safe, and it's always a good idea to keep your arsenic exposure as low as possible. 

As scientists are learning more about the importance of keeping arsenic exposure low, industry and food producers are already taking steps to reduce the amount of arsenic in the environment. The use of pesticides containing arsenic has been banned on food-producing land, and drug companies have removed arsenic from animal feed. Arsenic is no longer used to pressure-treat wood, and the FDA and international food safety groups are considering maximum limits for arsenic in food. 

## Take Responsibility 

Right now there are not limits to arsenic in food and if you drink from a private well, it is your responsibility to make sure your well does not contain arsenic. This is particularly important if you are pregnant or have infants or children in your house, since arsenic may negatively affect growth and development. It is also important to eat a varied diet to make sure you're getting balanced nutrition, and avoiding excessive arsenic exposure from any one food or beverage.
