## Should you be concerned about arsenic?

It depends. But finding out how you might be exposed to arsenic is a good place to start. 

**Review the pages** in this site to see if your diet includes food or drinks that are higher in arsenic or if you might be exposed to other sources. 

**Follow the steps** outlined on each page to reduce your arsenic exposure if necessary. [include map of site?] See the Resource links for helpful tools, videos and more detailed information. (put links to the pages mentioned here?)

## Why is arsenic a problem?

**You can't see smell, or taste arsenic**. At very high doses, arsenic is poisonous and causes serious and immediate health effects, but in the U.S., levels of arsenic in food and water are usually too low to cause obvious symptoms or make you sick right away.
 
Most people in this country are exposed by taking in small amounts of arsenic every day through food, water and other sources at levels that may increase their risk of diseases like cancer, heart disease and diabetes later in life. [link to health effects] Since arsenic causes cancer, no level of exposure is completely safe. 

## What can **you** do?

* If you have a private well, get your water tested.  
* If you eat a lot of rice or other foods that are higher in arsenic [link to food pages} eat them less often or vary with others types of food that are lower in arsenic. 
* If you are pregnant or have infants or children in your home, be sure your family's diet is as low in arsenic as possible since arsenic may negatively affect growth and development. 
* Eat a varied diet to make sure you're getting balanced nutrition. 
* Don't completely stop eating a food if it still provides nutritional benefits. 
* Stop smoking (link to other sources page). 
* Review this site to better understand your total arsenic exposure.  
* Reduce your total arsenic exposure by following the recommendations in this website.

##Where is the arsenic?

Arsenic is in soil, air, water, plants and animals. As scientists are learning more about the importance of keeping arsenic exposure low, industry and food producers are already taking steps to reduce the amount of arsenic in the environment: 

* The use of pesticides containing arsenic has been banned on food-producing land.  
* Drug companies have removed arsenic from animal feed.  
* Arsenic is no longer used to pressure-treat wood.  
* The FDA and international food safety groups are considering maximum limits for arsenic in food.  

But since it's impossible to totally eliminate arsenic from the world, it is up to you to decrease your arsenic exposure by making careful choices about your diet, your drinking water and other arsenic sources [link to other sources page].

* <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-regulatory-information#chemcont">Public water supplies</a>  are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  
* If you drink from a private well, it is your responsibility to make sure your well water does not contain arsenic.  
* Right now there are no regulatory limits for arsenic in food.
