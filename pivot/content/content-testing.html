## Should you be concerned about arsenic in your well water?

Yes. EVERYONE should test their well water for arsenic and other contaminants. If you are on a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-regulatory-information#chemcont" target="_blank">**public water system**</a>, learn about other sources of arsenic exposure by reviewing this website. You can also ask for your water consumer or quality report from your water provider. 

**Private well owners** should be particularly concerned if you live in an area where:
 
* Higher arsenic occurs naturally;
* Run-off from local industrial sites, orchards, farming or past land-use practices may have added arsenic to soil and water;
* Development or a change in your neighborhood is taking place.  

**Most people** in this country are exposed by taking in small amounts of arsenic every day through food, water and other sources at levels that may increase their <a href="24">risk of diseases</a> like cancer, heart disease and diabetes later in life. Since arsenic causes cancer, no level of routine exposure is completely safe.

  <figcaption>In the U.S., high concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic are more common in the West, Midwest, parts of Texas, and Northeast, but can occur almost anywhere. This map shows the probability of arsenic in private well water from 1 to 50 parts per billion. Remember, arsenic is not just a problem in those regions, so **<a href="20">test your well for arsenic</a> no matter where you live.** </figcaption>

##How do you know if there's arsenic in your well water?

**By Testing it**. Remember, **You can't see smell, or taste arsenic**. If your water comes from a private well, it's your responsibility to get your water tested to make sure that it is safe to drink. 

**Federal law** does not require private well owners to test or treat their water for contaminants, so unless your local city or town has a law to require well water safety, it is completely up to you to be sure that your family's water is healthy for drinking. 

**Test your well** no matter where you live, but in the U.S., high arsenic concentrations are more common in the West, the Midwest, parts of Texas, and the Northeast because of the type of rock that is naturally found in those regions. 

**Even if your neighbor's well** has no arsenic, **everyone's** well water needs testing since arsenic levels vary from well to well.
 
<div class="callout"><h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Test your well water for arsenic every 3-5 years. </li>
<li>Find an accredited testing laboratory or request a test kit from your state lab. </li>
<li>Follow the directions for collecting a water sample carefully to be sure that your test results are accurate. </li>
<li>If your well water has arsenic above 10 parts per billion, switch to bottled water for cooking and drinking right away, and contact your local or state health department to learn about your options for reducing your arsenic exposure. </li>
<li>Pregnant women, children, and people who are exposed to arsenic through food or other sources should reduce arsenic levels in water even if the levels are not above 10 parts per billion.</li> 
<li>Look into <a href="21">treatment systems</a> that reduce arsenic in water as close to zero as possible.</li>
<li>Eat a varied diet to make sure you're getting balanced nutrition.</li>
<li>Don't stop eating a food if it still provides nutritional benefits.</li>
<li>Review this site to understand your total arsenic exposure.</li>
<li>Reduce your total arsenic exposure by following the recommendations in this website.</li>
Lowering your arsenic exposure now could improve your long-term health.</li>

<h4>Is There Regulation of Arsenic in Water?</h4>
<p>Yes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-regulatory-information#chemcont" target="_blank">public water systems</a> to reduce arsenic levels in water to <a href="29">10 parts per billion</a>. Federal law does not require private well owners to test or treat their water for contaminants, although local or state requirements may exist where you live. For the most part, it is your responsibility to learn what is in your water and take steps to be sure your water is safe to drink.</p>

<h4>A Summary of Arsenic Levels</h4>
	<li><strong>0 ppb</strong> EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (not enforced).</li>

	<li><strong>2 ppb</strong> Average arsenic levels in U.S. drinking water.</li>

	<li><strong>5 ppb</strong> New Jersey's Maximum Contaminant Level (enforced). More cautious than federal limits.</li>

	<li><strong>10 ppb</strong> EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level (enforced). Set in 2001 based on cost and feasibility.</li>

	<li><strong>50 ppb</strong> Outdated EPA Maximum Contaminant Level. Drinking water at this level results in a 1 in 100 cancer risk, as well as associations with heart disease and impaired lung function.</li>
 
	<li><strong>250 ppb</strong> level at which whole house treatment is recommended to avoid skin exposure.</li>

<h4>Use <em>Be Well Informed</em> With Your Test Results</h4>
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services has developed an online tool called <a href="https://xml2.des.state.nh.us/DWITool/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">Be Well Informed</a> to help you interpret your water testing results. Plug the results of your water test in to the tool and it will provide an easy to understand explanation about health risks and water treatment options. You do not need to live in New Hampshire to use this tool.

##How do you test your well for arsenic?

Collecting a water sample and sending it to a lab will tell you how much arsenic is in your water and whether you should use a treatment system to reduce your exposure.

**Follow these steps**:

* The Water Systems Council maintains a website that provides <a href="https://www.watersystemscouncil.org/well-owners/water-testing-by-state/" target="_blank">water testing resources for every state</a>. Click on your state to get more information on water testing and treatment.
* Contact your state laboratory accreditation program for a list of licensed laboratories in your area.
* Find a state or private laboratory that is accredited to perform drinking water tests.  
* Contact your local health department for a list of common contaminants in your area and the water tests you should order.
* Select a laboratory and call to order an arsenic test kit and any other water tests. Ask your lab contact: “Are you accredited to analyze Drinking Water compliance samples?”
* To Test for arsenic: an arsenic test kit usually costs less than $30. The laboratory will mail a test kit and directions to your home. 
* Collect your water sample from the tap that you drink from the most often: for most households that is the kitchen sink. Carefully follow the sample collection instructions provided by the laboratory.
* Mail or bring the sample back to the lab. For an arsenic water test only, you do not need to refrigerate or overnight ship the sample, but if you're also testing for other contaminants you should be sure you are following the proper instructions for how the water sample should be stored and shipped.

You will receive your test results in the mail. Once you get the results, consider having another test done to confirm the results.

Depending on where you live, help with testing your well and understanding the test results might be available from your:

* municipal, county, or state health department
* Cooperative Extension Service
* state drinking water agency

**If you are buying a new home**:
 
* Ask about a water test, and learn whether the buyer or the seller is responsible for the water test or for treatment if the test shows that the water is not safe to drink. 
* Some states, local governments, or mortgage lenders require a drinking water test before a property with a well is purchased or sold, but those required tests don't always include arsenic. 

**Be sure to always**:
 
* Test your well water before you use it for the first time.  
* Test on a regular schedule.

##What do my test results mean?

When your receive your water test results report, check your <a href="https://www.watersystemscouncil.org/well-owners/water-testing-by-state/" target="_blank">state private well water information page</a> to see if there is a tool available to help you understand your test results and/or use the results to determine what type of treatment you might need to make your water safe to drink.

If your water test says you have arsenic levels greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href="29">Maximum Contaminant Level</a>, then keep reading to learn about <a href="21">treatment options</a>. If your levels are at or below <a href="29">10 parts per billion</a>, it is still worth considering installing a treatment system to remove arsenic since no amount of arsenic exposure is totally safe. 

The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services has developed an online tool called <a href="https://xml2.des.state.nh.us/DWITool/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">**Be Well Informed**</a> to help you interpret your water testing results. Plug the results of your water test in to the tool and it will provide an easy to understand explanation about health risks and water treatment options. You do not need to live in New Hampshire to use this tool.

If you test for arsenic only and find that you need to treat for it, you will need to test your water again to find out if there are other contaminants in your water, as the type of treatment system you might use depends on everything that is in your water.
 
“Point-of-use” (e.g., under the sink or at the tap) treatment can be both effective and relatively inexpensive; but treating all of the water used in your home might be needed. The options that are best for you depend on:

* the results of a comprehensive water test, 
* how you use the water in your home, 
* other factors such as your comfort level with taking responsibility for maintaining a treatment system.

## If there's no arsenic in your water, are there other ways you could be exposed to arsenic?

Yes, if you:
 
<ul>
	<li>Haven't tested since you bought your home you should test again. Test every 3-5 years.</li>
	<li>Eat a diet that may be high in foods that contain arsenic such as:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="19">Rice or rice products</a> </li>
			<li>certain <a href="13">seafoods</a> </li>
			<li>certain <a href="18">fruits, juices or vegetables</a></li>
			<li>certain <a href="17">wines or beers</a> </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>have an <a href="11">infant or young child</a> in your household who is drinking formula or eating first foods made with rice</li>
	<li>are a <a href="27">smoker</a></li>
	<li>are exposed to other sources of arsenic from pressure treated wood or industrial sites</li>
</ul>

>"If your drinking water comes from a private well, we recommend that you test your water to be sure that it is safe to drink. You can't see, taste or smell arsenic in drinking water, so the only way to know if your well has arsenic or other common contaminants is to get a water test. Some regions including New England, the Midwest, and the Southwest are naturally more likely to have high arsenic in the groundwater, but it's important for everyone to test their well for arsenic every 3-5 years."  <cite>Paul Susca, New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services</cite>
