## Why worry about arsenic in rice? 

Since most Americans are primarily exposed to arsenic through the food they eat, understanding the primary sources of dietary arsenic is an important first step to reducing arsenic exposure. In recent years, studies by health researchers and government agencies have found that rice and rice products contain relatively high levels of inorganic arsenic, the chemical form of arsenic that is most toxic. 

These findings do not mean that all rice is poisonous and should be eliminated completely from a balanced diet, but it is important to understand how much arsenic you and your family may be consuming through food and water, as well as identifying strategies to reduce exposure through simple choices in food purchasing and preparation.

Rice is an important food for many Americans, and it is a healthy and affordable carbohydrate that is important in many dishes and ethnic cuisines. People on gluten-free diets are also likely to consume more rice since rice is substituted for flour in many gluten-free products. Rice milk, rice-based formula, brown rice syrup and rice cereal are also common choices for adults or children with dietary sensitivities.

While rice can be a healthy component of a balanced diet, it naturally accumulates arsenic more readily than other plants. This is because of the plant's biology and growing conditions. Rice mistakes arsenic for silica and accumulates arsenic from both the soil and irrigation water when it's grown in flooded fields. The arsenic in soil and water is naturally occurring in some areas, though arsenic levels are higher in some rice fields due to historic use of pesticides and fertilizers containing arsenic. 

## Are there types of rice with less arsenic? 

Organic rice-growing methods do not eliminate arsenic from soil and water, so organic rice contains arsenic levels that are about the same as conventionally grown rice. Rice accumulates most arsenic in the bran, the outer covering of the rice kernel that is removed in the processing step that turns brown rice into white rice. Since white rice has no bran, it has about 80% less arsenic than brown rice, although it also has significantly less fiber and micronutrients. 

While all rice products contain some arsenic, testing has shown that certain varieties and regions have consistently lower levels of arsenic in rice. White basmati from India, Pakistan, and California, and sushi rice from the United States have low arsenic levels, as well as quick-cooking and instant rice. While brown rice contains higher levels of arsenic than white rice of the same variety, the lowest levels of arsenic in brown rice were found in brown basmati rice from India, Pakistan and California. 

## What if I'm gluten free? 

People avoiding gluten often choose rice as a substitute for bread or wheat flour in pastries, cookies, or crackers. This may lead to increased arsenic exposure if rice is your main choice for gluten-free carbohydrates. While you can still include rice in your mix of gluten free options, try diversifying to include millet, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat and potatoes, and check the labels of your favorite GF products to see how many of them contain rice.

## How much arsenic is safe? How do I know how much arsenic is in my food? 

The U.S. EPA has assessed the risk of arsenic exposure and set a maximum level of 10 parts per billion for arsenic in drinking water, although research shows that no level of arsenic is completely safe and exposure should be kept as low as possible, especially for children and pregnant women due to the harmful effects of arsenic exposure on child development. The U.S. FDA is responsible for monitoring and regulating arsenic in foods, and they are currently assessing the risk of arsenic exposure through rice and considering developing a maximum allowable level of arsenic in rice. Internationally, many national governments and international organizations are investigating and implementing upper limits on arsenic in rice to reduce the likelihood of unsafe arsenic exposure through food.

## Is arsenic in rice a bigger deal for kids? 

Babies and children under five eat around three times more food per pound of body weight than adults, which means that young children have three times greater exposure to inorganic arsenic from the same food item. Children also tend to have less diverse diets than adults, so it's particularly important to consider the amount of arsenic in foods children eat regularly such as rice cereals, rice-based infant formulas, and rice milk. The UK Food Standards Agency advises that children under four-and-a-half should not drink rice milk to reduce arsenic exposure.

## Strategies to reduce arsenic exposure through rice 

### Better Rice Options 

* White basmati from India, Pakistan, and California
* Sushi rice from the United States
* Quick-cooking and instant rice

### Better Brown Rice Options 

* Brown basmati rice from India, Pakistan and California. 

### Worse options 

* Rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas 

### Check the brand 

Some rice companies are testing and providing information on the amount of arsenic in their rice or rice-containing products; research your favorite brands to see if their products have low arsenic (examples: Nature's One, Lundberg Farms) Consumer Reports tested rice brands extensively and published the numbers so you can decide for yourself which brands you trust:  <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/magazine-articles/2012/November/Consumer%20Reports%20Arsenic%20in%20Food%20November%202012_1.pdf">http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/magazine-articles/2012/November/Consumer%20Reports%20Arsenic%20in%20Food%20November%202012_1.pdf</a>

## Substitutes for rice 

Wheat and oats tend to have lower arsenic levels than rice, as do gluten-free grains such as quinoa, millet and amaranth. The FDA recommends diversifying grains to maximize nutrition and suggests alternatives to rice such as oats, sweet potatoes and avocados as first solid foods for children.

## Rinse your rice 

Research has shown that rinsing raw rice thoroughly before cooking, then using a ratio of 6 cups water to 1 cup rice for cooking and draining the excess water afterward, removes about 30% of the rice's inorganic arsenic content. However, this method of cooking may sacrifice some of rice's nutritional value by removing some vitamins and nutrients as well as arsenic.
