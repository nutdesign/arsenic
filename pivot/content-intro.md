# Arsenic in Rice 

<p class="lead">Rice is the primary source of arsenic exposure for most Americans. Regularly consuming small amounts of arsenic can be harmful to human health, and reducing arsenic exposure is particularly important for pregnant women, infants and young children. While there's no need to eliminate rice from your diet completely, there are simple ways of reducing arsenic in your diet by making smart choices about how much rice you consume, how you cook rice, and what rice varieties and rice products you choose for your family.</p>
