MJY Notes
March 26, 2016

I realize some of my comments will be completely irrelevant, because of pre-1.0 level coding, or because settings aren't set yet (totally normal), etc. So I'm just documenting, doesn't need detailed responses necessarily. 


* This id hook inside of an h2 is a drag for content editors:

<h2 id="why-worry-about-arsenic-in-rice-">Why worry about arsenic in rice?</h2>

Perhaps auto-generated (thus not in Pivot) so we should be careful to either not use it or prevent auto-generation. That said, I know it could also be a hook to do expand/collapse or whatnot. Hopefully this is just a side-effect and doesn't matter. 

* No problem having the lead in it's own div. Perfect use of a Pivot template content block. All the content pages now have this broken out. 

* The navigation is it's own huge discussion, and we might consider focusing our first conversation around this specifically, because it probably touches all other decisions in some way.

* Added a 'footer' section, copying the "intro" class for speedy styling. Needs work, but basic content is present. Class should probably be ‘footer’ obvs.

* Converted the nav to pivot ids. 

* Converted all the content pages to the new draft template.

* Added inline css to the document head for pivot-based 'you are here' styling. Looks horrible, but you know where you are.
