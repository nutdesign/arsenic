MJY updates as of Nov 7

Using the validator, cleaned up some template/include organization. The basic templates validate. Some content pages have some issues based on content markup, I'll get to those later.

To-do list as of 5:00 pm Nov 7:

* The NIH logo might want a little more top-padding in the footer.

* Using this map image as an example, what are the preferred sizes for inline images? No captions planned at this time.  
http://yacavone.com/clients/toxicmetalsarsenic/draftsix/health/exposure.html

* HTML markup to link header text (link to home). Previously: Tried to link the header text to the home page, but this changes the color to the link styling. Tried briefly to fix this, couldn't figure it out. Thus: Need to link all three lines of header text to href="1" and maintain their current colors.

* The callout-2 div doesn't have a background color on mobile -- appears the same as regular body text. http://yacavone.com/clients/toxicmetalsarsenic/draftsix/health/children.html 

* Getting some "flash of unstyled content" when the page initially loads, due to menu bar. I thought I saw something about how to fix that, but can't find it now...


Notes from Lauire, prior to today's work:

* "Pull quote font size compared to size of font for regular text and headings" I assume she means she thinks it's too big. I like it, but I’m sure it could be somewhat smaller too. 

* "Links seem to show up well against a background color as opposed to the white." She suggests that more saturated link colors would be better.

* "The current Title “Arsenic and You” font size is too small compared to the first Header on the page (Welcome to Arsenic and You ." I suggested that the Title might be the right size, because visitors come for the information -- the title is for credibility and orientation, not promotion. 

* "Could you reduce the font size of the First Header (Welcome to Arsenic and You)? And if that means all the other sub-header size types need to be reduced as well I think that is fine." I'm not sure about this, but add it here for completeness. 

* "I would not reduce the text font size." I agree this is either done or in the final ballpark depending on what other font changes happen.

MJY updates as of Aug 31; site re-org for testing


* Sub-section index pages have gone away, so primary menu items no longer need links. However, removing the <a> tag causes the menu styling to break. Currently changed the href to "#".

* Tried to link the header text to the home page, but this changes the color to the link styling. Tried briefly to fix this, couldn't figure it out. Thus: Need to link all three lines of header text to href="1" and maintain their current colors.
