MJY updates as of Aug 31; site re-org for testing


* Sub-section index pages have gone away, so primary menu items no longer need links. However, removing the <a> tag causes the menu styling to break. Currently changed the href to "#".

* Tried to link the header text to the home page, but this changes the color to the link styling. Tried briefly to fix this, couldn't figure it out. Thus: Need to link all three lines of header text to href="1" and maintain their current colors.

=======================================

Oct 4 to-do list with SC:

done * Mobile: Line heights on headers
done * Mobile: Black bar width / color / style
done * Mobile: Margins or padding
done * Mobile: Font size relationships 
	[ looks good on mobile, still needs work on desktop methinks? ]

It includes evidence-based recommendations to help you reduce exposure to arsenic. While some may not be appropriate or possible for everyone, follow the suggestions that make sense for you. Any step taken to reduce exposure to arsenic makes a difference in lowering your chances of arsenic-related health risks.”
