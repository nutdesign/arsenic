MJY updates as of Aug 31; site re-org for testing


* Sub-section index pages have gone away, so primary menu items no longer need links. However, removing the <a> tag causes the menu styling to break. Currently changed the href to "#".

* Tried to link the header text to the home page, but this changes the color to the link styling. Tried briefly to fix this, couldn't figure it out. Thus: Need to link all three lines of header text to href="1" and maintain their current colors.


Oct 4 to-do list with SC:

done * Mobile: Line heights on headers
done * Mobile: Black bar width / color / style
done * Mobile: Margins or padding
done * Mobile: Font size relationships 
	[ looks good on mobile, still needs work on desktop methinks? ]

done * Mobile: Body font size increase

* Mobile: Header font sizes? 
	[ possibly still a little large? ]
	
done * Mobile: Tighten line-height on mobile headlines

* Maybe: Color bar at bottom of pull-quote (to match color bar at top)

* Recommendation box margin / padding

* Recommendation box full-width color?

* Footer styling

* Add recommendation disclaimer to the footer (“This site aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to reduce exposure to arsenic as much as possible. Some recommendations may not be appropriate or feasible for everyone; that's ok. Follow the recommendations that make sense for you. Any step you take to reduce your exposure to arsenic makes a difference in minimizing your chances of arsenic-related health risks.”
