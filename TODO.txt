MJY Updates Dec 5

Several website updates today (about two hours). You can review them at: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~arsenicandyou/ReviewDraft/

Notes:

* Revised colors and opacity for the menu and "what you can do" callout. 

* Slightly modified the green callout color to provide better text contrast for readability. 

* Placed the new home page collage. 

* Placed several, but not all, of the new banner graphics. Further notes below:

* There are several pages where there is more than one banner image listed in the spreadsheet. I'm not sure if the intent is to experiment and see what looks best, or to stack them in sequence. I only placed the first one for any given page based on what was listed in the spreadsheet.

* There are several images that have more than one page listed in the spreadshet. I'm not sure if the intent is to reuse the images, or to decide later which page gets which image. For now I only placed a banner image on a single page. (And, reiterating the above point, only one banner image per page.)

* Regarding the children_small image: It's too large for the existing text paragraph -- it makes first half of the bullet list wrap, but not the second half. Either 1) image needs to be smaller; or 2) needs to be more text in that paragraph. For now I have changed the image size from 275px square to 150px square so the text wraps correctly.

* Similar to the children_small image, the small beer and wine image won't work because wrapping bullet lists around images is problematic. (The Beer and Wine page is virtually all bullet lists.)  I did not place the image on the page.

* Image "alt text" added to all placed images so that accessibility screen readers have something to work with. Text was taken from the spreadsheet.

* Banner images placed: Children; Gluten-Free; Rice; Fruits, Juices, and Vegetables; Water Testing; Water Treatment; Other Sources. 

* Small images placed: Children. 

* Note: If some of the images are intended to be place within the body of the text they should not be banner sized, but more like 867px wide rather than the 1125px wide banner images. 

You should be able to move the images by cutting and pasting the <img> code — however, the banner images are currently 1125px wide, and I’m not sure what will happen if you put them in the body text block (I expect they would have to be resized, as noted above).

As I write this from Sydney it is about 11:00 am on Monday December 5. We are 16 hours ahead of Boston time. I’ll have another short work session availability on Wednesday (Aussie time). Please let me know if I can do anything to help during that session. 



MJY updates as of Nov 11

* Extensively updated the combined punch list Word doc. 

* Added a draft sitemap page (http://yacavone.com/clients/toxicmetalsarsenic/draftsix/sitemap.html)

* Added callout-2 to several pages.

* Adjusted font sizes of the title, program sponsor, h1 page heading, and pull quote.

* Changed color of program sponsor.

* Added three example colors for navigation menu backgrounds.

* Added sub-bullets to several pages.

* Updated the sidebar callout to show the green background on mobile.

* Put many images inside <figure> tag. But not all! What's the right approach here? 

* Fist cut at <figcaption> tag.  

* Made the lead overview text slightly darker.

* 


Alternate colors

Header: #2e84b3
nav-container: #123f57


MJY updates as of Nov 7

Using the validator, cleaned up some template/include organization. The basic templates validate. Some content pages have some issues based on content markup, I'll get to those later.

To-do list as of 5:00 pm Nov 7:

done * The NIH logo might want a little more top-padding in the footer.

* Using this map image as an example, what are the preferred sizes for inline images? No captions planned at this time.  
http://yacavone.com/clients/toxicmetalsarsenic/draftsix/health/exposure.html

* HTML markup to link header text (link to home). Previously: Tried to link the header text to the home page, but this changes the color to the link styling. Tried briefly to fix this, couldn't figure it out. Thus: Need to link all three lines of header text to href="1" and maintain their current colors.

* The callout-2 div doesn't have a background color on mobile -- appears the same as regular body text. http://yacavone.com/clients/toxicmetalsarsenic/draftsix/health/children.html 

* Getting some "flash of unstyled content" when the page initially loads, due to menu bar. I thought I saw something about how to fix that, but can't find it now...


Notes from Lauire, prior to today's work:

* "Pull quote font size compared to size of font for regular text and headings" I assume she means she thinks it's too big. I like it, but I’m sure it could be somewhat smaller too. 

done * "Links seem to show up well against a background color as opposed to the white." She suggests that more saturated link colors would be better.

done * "The current Title “Arsenic and You” font size is too small compared to the first Header on the page (Welcome to Arsenic and You)." I suggested that the Title might be the right size, because visitors come for the information -- the title is for credibility and orientation, not promotion. 

done * "Could you reduce the font size of the First Header (Welcome to Arsenic and You)? And if that means all the other sub-header size types need to be reduced as well I think that is fine." I'm not sure about this, but add it here for completeness. 

done * "I would not reduce the text font size." I agree this is either done or in the final ballpark depending on what other font changes happen.

MJY updates as of Aug 31; site re-org for testing


* Sub-section index pages have gone away, so primary menu items no longer need links. However, removing the <a> tag causes the menu styling to break. Currently changed the href to "#".

* Tried to link the header text to the home page, but this changes the color to the link styling. Tried briefly to fix this, couldn't figure it out. Thus: Need to link all three lines of header text to href="1" and maintain their current colors.
