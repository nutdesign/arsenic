This website was created by the Columbia Superfund Research Program to to raise awareness about the issue of arsenic in private wells in New Jersey, as well as to spur at-risk residents to action, testing and subsequently treating their water, if necessary. The site contains high quality videos about arsenic’s health effects, testing water for arsenic, and installing an arsenic treatment system. There are also pages on testing, treatment, and FAQs about arsenic in well water. Even if you aren’t from New Jersey, the information on this site is relevant to private well owners everywhere!
