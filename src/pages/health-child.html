<h1>Arsenic and Your Child</h1>

<p class="lead">Children exposed to inorganic arsenic may not look or act sick at all. Very high arsenic exposures may result in stomach irritation, skin changes, and nerve damage. There is evidence that long-term exposure to arsenic in children may result in lower IQ scores and may increase mortality in young adults. (ATSDR) </p>

## What are the Health Effects of Arsenic?

Studies have found that arsenic exposure for young children, even at levels near the arsenic maximum contaminant level, may affect children's growth, immune function, and lifetime risk of developing cancer. 

Arsenic can cross the placenta, meaning that arsenic exposure for pregnant women may affect developing fetuses. Arsenic intake for pregnant women, infants and children should be as low as possible. The arsenic content of most infant and children food products is not regulated or labeled. 

### Water

If you have a private well, test your water for arsenic. If your well contains greater than 10 parts per billion of arsenic, immediately switch to bottled water and make a plan to reduce your drinking water's arsenic levels, either by installing an arsenic treatment system, joining a public water supply, or digging a new well. 

If you are pregnant, or if you have infants or young children in your family, you may want to consider reducing arsenic levels to 5 ppb rather than the EPA MCL of 10 ppb since children are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of arsenic exposure. If you choose an arsenic treatment system that only removes arsenic from a single tap, ensure that children do not swallow water while bathing or brushing their teeth.

### Infant formula

Studies have shown that breast-fed infants have lower arsenic exposure than infants who are fed formula. If you do choose formula for your infant, check the ingredients to see if it contains rice or brown rice syrup. When possible, choose a formula without these ingredients and consider a cows' milk or soy protein-based infant formula. Research the brands of baby formula you purchase to see if there is any information available about the amount of arsenic in the formulas they offer. Also, when mixing powdered or concentrated formula with water, it is very important to use water with as little arsenic as possible. Use bottled water if you are concerned about the amount of arsenic in your drinking water.


> While seafood contains relatively high amounts of total arsenic, almost all of this is arsenobetaine, which is completely safe for human consumption. Consumers should only be concerned about arsenic in seafood if they consume large amounts of rare shellfish found in the Pacific Northwest or if they are eat a lot of seaweed or take seaweed supplements regularly. <cite>June Smith, Professor of Science, College University</cite>

### Rice and rice products

Because or rice's availability, nutritional value, and low allergenic potential, rice and rice products such as starch, flour and syrup are common in infant foods and drinks. Infant rice cereal is a popular first food, but other foods are equally acceptable as a first food. Consider cereals made from other grains, vegetable purees, sweet potatoes, or finely chopped meat. 

### General Diet

Since children eat less varied diets than adults, contaminated food, juice, or infant formula may contribute a concerning amount of arsenic exposure. For children, eating a varied diet is an important way to decrease a child's exposure to environmental toxins in any one food. Plus eating a wide range of foods provides a variety of nutrients to support healthy growth and development. While children can include rice in a balanced diet, make sure to also include a variety of grains such as oats, barley, wheat and corn. 

Soils in some parts of the country naturally contains high levels or arsenic. When children play outside, make sure they do not put dirt in their mouths, and if you grow your own fruits and vegetables or buy them from a farmer's market, wash them carefully to remove dirt that may contain arsenic.

### CCA Pressure Treated Wood

Before 2002, pressure treated wood used in decks, playground equipment and picnic tables was treated with CCA, a preservative that contains arsenic. For existing CCA-treated structures (you can test to learn if your deck or play structure was treated with CCA), the best way to minimize arsenic leaching is to apply a sealant every two years. Arsenic can move to the surface of treated wood and be picked up on hands and ingested by children. You should also make sure that kids wash their hands after playing on play structures to wash of any arsenic residues from CCA-treated wood. If possible, avoid eating directly off of wooden picnic tables by using a plastic tablecloth or a tray.

### Fruit Juice

Arsenic in fruit juices has been a source of concern in the past. The FDA has proposed an action level to ensure that apple juice contains no more than 10 ppb of arsenic, the same amount allowed in drinking water. Still, the American Association of Pediatrics recommends that parents try to limit the amount of sweet beverages fruit juice your child drinks, both to reduce potential arsenic exposure through fruit juice and to reduce risk of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. 

### Rice milk

The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommends that infants and young children avoid rice drinks.  Consider alternatives to rice milk for young children, such as oat milk, soy milk and almond milk.
