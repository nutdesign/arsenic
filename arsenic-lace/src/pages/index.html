            <h2>Should you be concerned about arsenic?</h2>
            <p>Arsenic isn't just a deadly poison from a mystery story. But since you can't taste it, smell it or see it, you can see why it was used as one. In the U.S., many people are exposed to small amounts of arsenic through their food and drinking water at levels that may increase their risk of certain diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>
            <p>By following the simple recommendations in this website, you can reduce your total arsenic exposure. Reducing your arsenic exposure now could improve your long-term health.</p>
            <p>Protecting against low-level arsenic exposure is challenging because arsenic is a metal that's found in soil, air, water, plants and animals. However, there is variation in the amount of arsenic in water and in food, and it's possible to decrease your arsenic exposure significantly by making smart choices about your diet and your drinking water. Since arsenic is a carcinogen, or a substance that causes cancer, there is no level of arsenic exposure that is completely safe, and it's always a good idea to keep your arsenic exposure as low as possible. </p>
            <p>As scientists are learning more about the importance of keeping arsenic exposure low, industry and food producers are already taking steps to reduce the amount of arsenic in the environment. The use of pesticides containing arsenic has been banned on food-producing land, and drug companies have removed arsenic from animal feed. Arsenic is no longer used to pressure-treat wood, and the FDA and international food safety groups are considering maximum limits for arsenic in food. </p>
            <h2>Is arsenic regulated?</h2>
            <p>Right now there are not regulatory limits for arsenic in food. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-regulatory-information#chemcont">Public water supplies are regulated</a> by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but if you drink from a private well, it is your responsibility to make sure your well does not contain arsenic. This is particularly important if you are pregnant or have infants or children in your house, since arsenic may negatively affect growth and development. It is also important to eat a varied diet to make sure you're getting balanced nutrition, and avoiding excessive arsenic exposure from any one food or beverage.</p>
            <h2>Reduce your exposure</h2>
            <p>While it's impossible to totally eliminate arsenic from the world, keeping your arsenic intake as close to zero as possible is a good goal. At very high doses, arsenic causes serious and immediate health effects (that's why people know it best as a poison), but in the U.S., levels of arsenic in food and water are usually too low to cause obvious symptoms or make you sick right away. But taking in small amounts of arsenic every day through your food and water can increase your risk of getting certain diseases later in life unless you take action now to reduce your exposure.</p>
